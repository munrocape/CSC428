###Due Date: October 7th, 2015, 11:59pm

###PART 1: Topic Description (50/100 pts)

```
Write a proposal describing a HCI research topic that your team will address for the class project
Include a justification explaining why you think your project is an interesting HCI research topic.
Your topic description is met to be a high level description (in simple and clear text) that
introduces the instructor and the TA to your research project. Your topic description is very
important because it formalizes what your team is trying to do.

As smartphone processors and battery lives have improved, multitasking is now supported on many devices. This means that a user can have many applications (apps) open at once and switch between them to save start up time for a given app.
Furthermore, apps that were once monoliths - like Facebook -  are now split into many constituent apps like Messenger, Paper, and a now smaller app still called Facebook. Finally, the methods for users to manage their active apps vary across devices. 

This paper aims to identify which methods are effective and frindly means to allow a user to manage apps whether their task is to switch to an already open app, open a new instance of an app, or close an app down.

###PART 2: Initial Literature Review (50/100 pts)

```
The purpose of this part is to do an initial literature review for your project that will help you
understand better the context of your research topic and the theoretical and contextual issues that
constrain and influence your project. Your literature review should be on your specific research
topic at least four (4) published papers (from journals or conferences) that are relevant to your
HCI research project. Note that this is a preliminary literature review. Your team will be able to
change and add references in the final version of the paper (the final version of the paper will
have to include at least six (6) published papers).
The literature review must written in full sentences (no bullet points). Organize your literature
review such that the current state of the art is reviewed, followed by the identification of your
research topic. The review should be between 500 - 750 words. All cited papers must be listed in
a reference section at the end of your literature review and follow the CHI reference style (see
CHI template).
```

###What to submit
```
Your project proposal must be typed and submitted as an electronic copy. The document can be
in Microsoft Word .DOC or Adobe Acrobat PDF formats. 

Your document must also include:
• Team member names and email addresses on the cover page. DO NOT include
STUDENT NUMBERS.
• A group name
Additionally, complete a Group Information Form (see Portal). Much of the information will be
helpful to you as a group, but the photos will especially help the TA and the instructor learn your
names.
Submit both your proposal and the group information form through the UofT portal
(Blackboard). One submission per group; the instructor will assign you a group number and a
TA.
