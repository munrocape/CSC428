## Notice: Tutorial this wednesday. Bring your drafts.

#### Experimental design is due next tutorial. St Cyr will be leading it.

##### Exam: Dec 18. 7pm.

Internal validity: if you are testing speed of android v. iphone, if your test base is all iphone users, then this will skew (pre-dispositions). 

Longer test times can help smooth things out or allowing a learning curve to be determined.

Pre-screening can help with identifying the biases in advance.

Be wary that the result that you find or conclude that it can be externalized - are you sure the findings will hold once it is released?

`Generalizability is important`

There is a tradeoff between simulation and getting real data. "Internal and external validity trade off"

The more realistic it is, the less likely there is for all inputs to be controlled and understood. 

Tight internal validity => it cant be generalized.

`Null hypothesis`

Assume there is no difference until you can demonstrate one.
