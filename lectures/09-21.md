#### Why was HCI needed?

Ubiquitous computing = computers that are everywhere in the environment (and sometimes we don’t even notice them)
What you see is what you get— wysiwyg
Big principle in HCI — phone is the same idea (zoom on a picture, it zooms in)
	⁃what you do from a cognitive point of you is matching the field of view that you’re perceiving
	⁃control theory: how people adjust to error— we perceive info from the world and we have a threshold in our head which is our error rate. We perceive information and act on it, ifwhat we do matches what we expect to happen on the computer, then there is low error rate
	⁃ex: I do A, I expect A but the computer is giving me B — there is a delta/gap between what happened and what I thought would happen
	⁃I try to reduce the error/delta between where I should be and where I expect to be. When things start making sense, it is when what I do results in what I expect, then you conclude the action is correct and  the delta/error decreases
	⁃If your computer gives you visual feedback about what you’re doing and what you do is what you expect to do, then the error rate goes down

#### HCI Research

The UX aspect is fundamental, but a lot of the cool ideas for UI come from laboratory and research labs where people have studied the problems. Then companies pick up on them and turn them into UX

#### Interaction

What is the interaction?
Whenever you interact with a piece of machinery, you are in interaction
The computer replies to you, you sense the response, you process, you either respond again or change your response until you believe your interaction is fine turned enough in order for you to get what you want out of your machine. What you believe a fine tuned interaction may be for your task may differ from other people’s ideas

#### Interaction Elements

We have to look at time and time scale (Chapter 2)
Different ways we perceive time
Unit tasks- you have to type, you have to visually identify whether what you type is correct, then you have to click the send button— a range of things to do combined into a task

#### GUI Malleability

Amount of information we have in the real estate is huge
With hard controls, it’s not as bad because they are in position and they stay in position— you can’t add more buttons to a row of buttons if there is no more space

#### Control-Display Relationships

There has to be an established relationship between elements
Spatial relationship— coordinate system mappings
	⁃if you have a mouse cursor relationship, there is a relationship between the way you move the cursor and the way it moves on the screen
	⁃dynamic- game controllers. Acceleration will be sensed by the controller and it is translated to what happens on the computer/screen— maps correct response. Joysticks, wiimote

#### Spatial Relationship

Learning curve/why a UI is difficult to use
What makes a UI intuitive or easy to use?
A natural spacial congruence— when you repsond to the computer in one way, the state will map exactly what you’ve done
Moving a mouse: you’ve moved your finger to the right, the cursor moves to the right, there is a spacial congruence mapping. It maps what you are perceiving to what you are doing

Natural/spatial congruence eases the use of the UI

Spatial transformation
You move your mouse one way but the result is that the cursor moves another way

#### Axis Labeling 

Movement in z is incongruent, movement in x is congruent

#### Third Tier

Pitch 
Yaw
Rotate

Google Streetview: x movement means yaw movement. Image is fixed and its rotating around the y axis
Your mouse is a 2D device

Up and down: pitch- rotating image around the x axis but on the mouse it is a plus z and minus z movement

#### 3D in Interactive Systems

In a 3D immersive UI, you can get motion sick— if the machine changes state and rerenders, your brain senses something is wrong— you empty your stomach and faint (survival mechanism) 
3D game mappings are getting better, but before people would get motion sick

Human Factors Model

When you have 2 degrees of freedom and 6 on the screen what happens?
