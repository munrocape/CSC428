* Mostly covered a sample paper, which he'll post online *

* Participants *
- Approx people needed: 8-10 min per possible value of independent variable if "between-subjects"
  - We can use "within-subjects" so we only need 8-10, but we should probably get 15-20
- Collect people's ages
- State where we collected participants
- State that they were remunerated for their participation
- Participants should be representative of the population we want to study

* Apparatus and Stimuli *
- We need multiple trials to take an average of the times
- Counteract participant fatigue by counterbalancing
  - Test conditions are administered in a different order to each group
  - Order of administering test conditions uses a Latin square: each condition occurs precisely once in each row and column

* Task Design *
- Task must "elicit a change"
- Good qualities: represent activities people do with the interface, discriminate among the test conditions
- When people do my study what do they do (list in point form)?
- Need to be very explicit

* Procedure *
- Procedure encompasses everything that occurs with participants
  - Includes: welcoming, signing consent form, instructions, demonstration trials, rest breaks, questionaires
- We should do a couple test runs

* Instruction *
- Read instructions sentence by sentence to participants
